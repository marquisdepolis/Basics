# Basics
Some basic calls to use gpt I wanted to put in one place so I don't have to call them again and again
It chooses the right prompts under the hood, based on Creative vs Scholarly vs Normal, and has a bunch of background about me. Took the prompts from John Beatty and Sam McRoberts and twisted and tweaked them a bunch.

It also keeps a stateful history of the messages, at least until the prompt window's full!

Plan is that when I make more things, I wanted one place to call the functions I needed. And also made a web frontend, because why not!
